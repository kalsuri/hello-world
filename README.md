# hello-world
This repository is for practising GitHub Flow.

I am a human on planet earth who is constantly overwhelmed by eschitological anxiety.
My professional pursuit is in the field of mathematics.
A dog named North Star, is my favorite thing on the planet.

My fear of commitment makes it hard to commit changes to code.
